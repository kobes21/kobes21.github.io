<h2>
Marine Mammal Science <br>
</h2>

<p>
The <strong>Marine Mammal Science Society</strong> student chapter meeting is coming up on the 5th-7th of November at Macquarie University. This is a great chance to catch up on all the current research being carried out on marine mammals in Australia and New Zealand. <br><br>

There will be presentations as well as posters. Come see my presentation "Does size matter? Adaptations by aquatic mammals for underwater acoustic communication."

<p>
Such a great experience at the student chapter meeting for the society of marine mammalogy. So much great research being done in Australia and New Zealand by research students. From photo IDing, swimming metabolic rates, tooth function to seal diets and capture methods. <br><br>

It was great to have representatives from Taronga and Dolphin Marine Magic there to discuss research that has been done on their captive animals and how they are using those results to further improve their husbandry practices. There was some philosophical/ethical contemplation about the roles of captive institutions and their role in the conservation of our marine mammals. It was great to get so many different points of view. <br><br>

Overall, a very successful and enjoyable meeting, and of course it was fantastic to meet some lovely new people who share my passion for marine mammals and I hope to keep in touch with them as my research continues.
