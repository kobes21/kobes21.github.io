<h2>
Marine Mammal Science <br>
</h2>

<p>
The <strong>Marine Mammal Science Society</strong> student chapter meeting is coming up on the 5th-7th of November at Macquarie University. This is a great chance to catch up on all the current research being carried out on marine mammals in Australia and New Zealand. <br><br>

There will be presentations as well as posters. Come see my poster "Does size matter? Adaptations by aquatic mammals for underwater acoustic communication."
