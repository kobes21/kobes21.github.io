## Marine Mammal Science
The **Marine Mammal Science Society** student chapter meeting is coming up on the 5th-7th of November at Macquarie University. This is a great chance to catch up on all the current research being carried out on marine mammals in Australia and New Zealand.

There will be presentations as well as posters. Come see my poster "Does size matter? Adaptations by aquatic mammals for underwater acoustic communication."
