<h2>
Acoustic Recording
</h2>

<p>
Having moved into the captivity portion of my research I have been in and out of zoos, sanctuaries and wildlife parks a lot over the past months. Leaving recorders overnight to be collected the next day and waiting for analysis. The official analysis phase will commence next year, but as a lover of acoustics I just couldn't wait that long to take a look. Never before have I been so appreciative of acousticians' ability to observe and describe animal calls. A single 10 minute sound grab displays tens to hundreds of calls produced by various animals. Studying mammals, these calls are often not from my study species. I have begun to appreciate why acoustic behaviouralists have focused so steadfastly on birds. Not only do their songs sounds beautiful, but they LOOK beautiful too. The complexities visible on a spectrogram are incredible. The trills, the runs, even the simplest sweeps are to be admired like art. I could easily frame their song and hang it on my wall to be admired. Rather than making me despair for my choice to study mammal acoustics instead of birds, it makes me appreciate all the more when I catch that fleeting glimpse of a glider squeaking, or a sea lion clucking.
